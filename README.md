# wedding_webpage

This repo contains the public folder for the website I built to make the process of informing guests, managing wishlists and receiving responses to invitations easier. But first of all, I built it in order to learn how to make a website from scratch, which is also reflected in the code quality. Initially it primarily consists of modified "copy-paste" code snippets, while I have written the final parts myself.

The website is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript and uses Google Firebase as backend. It can be viewed [here](https://henrikogjulie.web.app).
